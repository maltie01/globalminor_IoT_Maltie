First day introduction Maltie
My name is Maltie-Carmelita Parsoe. I am 20 years old. I do not have a lot of programming experience. You can even say I do not have any experience. I did something with C++ and Php 4 years ago and c# has been a couple years ago too. I have some experience SQL and R. 
I have done nothing with micro controllers and single board computers.
A maker is a person that uses their abilities to create, whether it be mechanical, electrical, musical, visual or anything else. I like that it means that it does not matter which subject it is about. Because I am not very technical  I hope I can contribute in a different way.
There is a lot of things to know about IoT but main things that I keep in mind are sensors and that IoT is bigger than you think. More things are considered IoT than we think.
I don’t really have big expectations. I just want to learn a lot about stuff I do not know yet and be able to contribute to the project in a way I am comfortable about. But maybe step out of my comfort zone sometimes.

Reflection lesson day 1 Maltie
First half of the day we had a long lecture with some exercises in between. An exercise was to find out what kind of domains, protocols and devices there are:
Domains:
•	smart buildings and living
•	smart healthcare
•	smart environment
•	smart city
•	smart energy
•	smart transport and mobility
•	smart manufacturing and retail
•	smart agriculture.

Protocols:
•	Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)
•	ZigBee.
•	Bluetooth.
•	Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)
•	Data-Distribution Service (DDS)
•	Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)
•	Lightweight M2M (LwM2M)
•	HTTP

Devices:
•	“Smart” Home Devices.
•	Industrial Sensors.
•	Smart Automobiles.
•	Smart Cameras.
•	Manufacturing Robots.
•	Healthcare/Fitness Devices.

We also watched some videos. The answers to the questions that were about these videos are written below:
Like a Bosch video:
I see some problems with that it may be unnecessary to have some smart things in the video. I also see that there are a lot of opportunities for danger. A self driving car is proven to not fully deserve the trust. An oven you can turn on when you are not at home is a fire hazard. Etc.

Second video:
We try to smartify everything, we put IoT in everything.
Security in IoT easy?

Third video:
Why esp8266? 
Programmability and price.
You can use a lot of different programming styles for it.
You can also add a lot to it if you want. Like buttons.
It has power regulation itself.
It is very affordable.

What is personally inspiring for you?
A very small device that can do amazing things for it sizes. Size does not matter apparently!

What is the connection to coffee?
ESP stands for Espresso.
Starting with the hardware today. I received the package from Johanna so that I can work on my own in my room. I downloaded the CH340 driver and Arduino and installed the esp8266 package on it. The problem I had was that my Arduino is in Dutch and that the tutorials are in English. But after figuring some words out it was fine. I have Arduino now in English so I can search things more easy on the internet.
During the exercises I had a couple of problems, I wanted to see the number of lines because I could not follow the teacher that easily, I forgot to update the code and I got a weird output from that and I had some network problems. 
The network problems were easily solved by making a hotspot on my laptop and put the sensor on the hotspot.
Why is off = on and on = off? Hardware reasons, not our fault.
